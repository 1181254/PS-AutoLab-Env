# Just Enough Administration Samples and Resources
Just Enough Administration (JEA) is a PowerShell security technology that provides a role based access control platform for anything that can be managed with PowerShell.
It enables authorized users to run specific commands in an elevated context on a remote machine, complete with full PowerShell transcription and logging.
JEA is included in PowerShell version 5 and higher on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, and older OSes with the Windows Management Framework updates.

This repository contains sample role capabilities created by the Microsoft IT team and the official DSC resource that can be used to deploy JEA across your enterprise.
General information and documentation for JEA has migrated to [MSDN](http://aka.ms/JEAdocs).# Just Enough Administration Samples and Resources
